# Proposal
Xiaohan Yang, Jingjing Sun

Here is our activity proposal:

One of us will make a CSV file populated with student information.
That person will read in the file into netbeans.
The other person will populate a HashMap with those student info. And she will also delete several students by the key of the HashMap.
Sounds good.Which type of students need to be delete?
